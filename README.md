# Deep-Bushfire-Detection
This project aims to study how different detection / segmentation models perform on our smoke dataset, obtained from cameras on fire towers around the ACT. The goal is to apply both weakly-supervised learning with bounding-box labels, as well as fully-supervised learning (image segmentation) to the dataset and evaluate their performance. 

# Faster-RCNN Object Detection with Pytorch
The first part of this project involes data preparation and applying Faster-RCNN for object detection. The code follows closey to this tutorial on custom object detection with Faster-RCNN (https://debuggercafe.com/custom-object-detection-using-pytorch-faster-rcnn/).
